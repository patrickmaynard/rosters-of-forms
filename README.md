# form-rosters
This repository will be a holding area for form rosters in the United States.

A form roster is a document that tracks the forms maintained by a police department, sheriff's office or other policing organization. It can be extremely useful for both journalists and citizen activists, as it allows the public to see what information a law-enforcement organization tracks. This, in turn, can facilitate more efficient information requests.
