# Rosters of police forms
This repository will be a holding area for forms rosters in the United States.

A forms roster is a document that tracks the forms maintained by a police department, sheriff's office or other policing organization. It can be extremely useful for both journalists and citizen activists, as it allows the public to see what information a law-enforcement organization tracks. This, in turn, can facilitate more efficient information requests.

This repository is based on initial work done in the Baltimore Sun newsroom. It has since been expanded with additional form lists.
