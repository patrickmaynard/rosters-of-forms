# A note

This folder contains (at the very least) the roster of forms for the Albuquerque police department. 

I messed up the folder structure, which would normally contain an extra folder for Albuquerque. 

I would change it, but I've already shared the link. So just know that "apd" in a PDF filename means Albuquerque Police Department.
