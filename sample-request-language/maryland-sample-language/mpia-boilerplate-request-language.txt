This is a request under the Maryland Public Information Act as amended and listed in title 4 of the general provisions of Maryland’s state code. 

I wish to inspect and receive a copy of any “form roster” document held or maintained by your law enforcement organization. Such a document is also sometimes referred to as a “review of forms,” “forms roster,” “forms list,” “[form/s] table of contents,” “forms management program” listing or  “forms index,” and/or plural variations of these terms. Screenshots of document listings are also acceptable. 

Status as a public document

Form rosters are a key part of the public accountability process. By showing what is tracked by an office or department, a form roster facilitates citizen oversight of local agencies -- an important part of any representative government system. 

It is no surprise, then, that the requesters have been granted access to form rosters by law enforcement agencies in dozens of jurisdictions. We view this access as a clear affirmation of the public nature of this document. 

Additional details 
 
As you know, state public information laws provide that if portions of a document are exempt from release, the remainder must be segregated and disclosed. Therefore, I request that you provide all nonexempt portions of the records I have requested, and ask that you justify any deletions by reference to specific exemptions of the public information act.
 
I reserve the right to appeal your decision to withhold any materials. As I am making this request as part of a reporting project in the public interest, I ask that any fees be waived. If they cannot be waived, I ask that you consult me for approval of any fees before proceeding with the request.

As this information is of timely value, I would appreciate your calling or e-mailing, rather than communicating by mail, should you have any questions regarding this request. Thank you for your attention to this matter. I look forward to receiving your reply promptly, as required by law.
