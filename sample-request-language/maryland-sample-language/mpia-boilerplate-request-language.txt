Hi there!   
I'm a freelancer who's done writing for VICE, Truthout and The Independent. For a project I'm working on, I'd like to request what's known as a "roster of forms." This is essentially a list of all forms for internal and external use that a policing organization uses or maintains. It's sometimes also known as a "forms list," "forms roster," "index of forms" or via other names.   
As usual with public records requests, I'm asking that any redacted section cite the legal basis for the redaction, and that the remainder of any partially redacted documents be disclosed. As this request is being made for a journalism project in the public interest, I ask that any fees be waived.   
If you have any questions or need a sample of a responsive document from a neighboring jurisdiction's police organization, please don't hesitate to reach out. Thanks for what you do. It's useful work that serves the public well.   
All the best.
